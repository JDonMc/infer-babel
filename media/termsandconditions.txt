Tower of Bable User Agreement<br />
Effective September 24, 2018.<br />
Tower of Bable powers hundreds of thousands of distinct online communities.<br />
This User Agreement and your conduct make that possible.<br />
Hello, Bablers and people of the Internet! This Tower of Bable User Agreement ("Terms") applies to your access to and use of the websites, mobile apps, widgets, and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services") provided by TowerofBable.org ("Tower of Bable," "we," or "us").<br />
<br />
Remember Tower of Bable is for fun and is intended to be a place for your entertainment, but we still need some basic rules. By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use our Services.<br/>
<br/>
Please take a look at Tower of Bable’s Privacy Policy too—it explains how we collect, use, and share information about you when you access or use our Services.
<br/>
1. Your Access to the Services
Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to create an account or otherwise use the Services. Additionally, if you are in the European Economic Area, you must be over the age required by the laws of your country to create an account or otherwise use the Services, or we need to have received verifiable consent from your parent or legal guardian.
<br/>
In addition, certain of our Services or portions of our Services require you to be older than 13 years of age, so please read all notices and any Additional Terms carefully when you access the Services.
<br/>
If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of another legal entity, including a business or a government, you represent that you have full legal authority to bind such entity to these terms.
<br/>
2. Your Use of the Services
Tower of Bable grants you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, limited license to use and access the Services solely as permitted by these Terms. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you by these Terms.
<br/>
Except as permitted through the Services or as otherwise permitted by us in writing, your license does not include the right to:
<br/>
license, sell, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the Services or Content;
modify, prepare derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any part of the Services or Content; or
access the Services or Content in order to build a similar or competitive website, product, or service, except as permitted under the Tower of Bable API Terms of Use.
We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services (in whole or in part) at any time, with or without notice to you. Any future release, update, or other addition to functionality of the Services will be subject to these Terms, which may be updated from time to time. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services or any part thereof.
<br/>
3. Your Tower of Bable Account and Account Security
To use certain features of our Services, you may be required to create a Tower of Bable account (an "Account") and provide us with a username, password, and certain other information about yourself as set forth in the Privacy Policy.
<br/>
You are solely responsible for the information associated with Your Account and anything that happens related to Your Account. You must maintain the security of your Account and promptly notify Tower of Bable if you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your Account without your permission. We recommend that you use a strong password that is used only with the Services.
<br/>
You will not license, sell, or transfer your Account without our prior written approval.
<br/>
4. Your Content
The Services may contain information, text, links, graphics, photos, videos, or other materials (“Content”), including Content created with or submitted to the Services by you or through your Account (“Your Content”). We take no responsibility for and we do not expressly or implicitly endorse any of Your Content.
<br/>
By submitting Your Content to the Services, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, power, and authority necessary to grant the rights to Your Content contained within these Terms. Because you alone are responsible for Your Content, you may expose yourself to liability if you post or share Content without all necessary rights.
<br/>
You retain any ownership rights you have in Your Content, but you grant Tower of Bable the following license to use that Content:
<br/>
When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed. This license includes the right for us to make Your Content available for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with Tower of Bable. You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content.
<br/>
Any ideas, suggestions, and feedback about Tower of Bable or our Services that you provide to us are entirely voluntary, and you agree that Tower of Bable may use such ideas, suggestions, and feedback without compensation or obligation to you.
<br/>
Although we have no obligation to screen, edit, or monitor Your Content, we may, in our sole discretion, delete or remove Your Content at any time and for any reason, including for a violation of these Terms, a violation of our Content Policy, or if you otherwise create liability for us.
<br/>
5. Third-Party Content, Advertisements and Promotions
The Services may contain links to third-party websites, products, or services, which may be posted by advertisers, our affiliates, our partners, or other users (“Third-Party Content”). Third-Party Content is not under our control, and we are not responsible for any of their websites, products, or services. Your use of Third-Party Content is at your own risk and you should make any investigation you feel necessary before proceeding with any transaction in connection with such Third-Party Content.
<br/>
The Services may also contain sponsored Third-Party Content or advertisements. The type, degree, and targeting of advertisements are subject to change, and you acknowledge and agree that we may place advertisements in connection with the display of any Content or information on the Services, including Your Content.
<br/>
If you choose to use the Services to conduct a promotion, including a contest or sweepstakes, you alone are responsible for conducting the promotion in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The terms of your promotion must specifically state that the promotion is not sponsored by, endorsed by, or associated with Tower of Bable and the rules for your promotion must require each entrant or participant to release Tower of Bable from any liability related to the promotion.
<br/>
6. Things You Cannot Do
When accessing or using the Services, you must respect others and their rights, including by following these Terms and the Content Policy, so that we all may continue to use and enjoy the Services.

Intentionally negate any user's actions to delete or edit their Content on the Services; or
Access, query, or search the Services with any automated system, other than through our published interfaces and pursuant to their applicable terms. However, we conditionally grant permission to crawl the Services for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials subject to the parameters set forth in our robots.txt file.
7. Moderators
Moderating a subTower of Bable is an unofficial, voluntary position that may be available to users of the Services. We are not responsible for actions taken by the moderators. We recognize that moderation can take some work, so we may change the features or abilities associated with moderating from time to time without prior notice. We reserve the right to revoke or limit a user’s ability to moderate at any time and for any reason or no reason, including for a breach of these Terms.
<br/>

You may not enter into any agreement with a third party on behalf of Tower of Bable, or any subTower of Bables that you moderate, without our written approval;
You may not perform moderation actions in return for any form of compensation or favor from third parties;
If you have access to non-public information as a result of moderating a subTower of Bable, you will use such information only in connection with your performance as a moderator; and
You may create and enforce rules for the subTower of Bables you moderate, provided that such rules do not conflict with these Terms, our Content Policy, and the Moderator Guidelines for Healthy Communities.
Tower of Bable reserves the right, but has no obligation, to overturn any action or decision of a moderator if Tower of Bable believes that such action or decision is not in the interest of Tower of Bable or the Tower of Bable community.
<br/>

If you use AI, it needs to have the first two letters as AI or the last two letters as AI, or both. (To be released)
If you use trickle, it sponsors all the words of the authors who have posted in a space made from the words in the sponsorship phrase that are in that sponsored word's author's total dictionaries. That is, if you stamp a phrase with trickle, it attaches to anyone who has given the user feedback, so it marks the whole crowd. And now that it's on a new author, the next trickle goes again, but it's on all of their words now.
If the token is ever declared a currency then this will be a deductible.
Each trickle costs 1000 tokens.
It's for network affects of mass advertising, or flash advertising. If your campaign wants instant feedback, use higher trickles, but any more than about 3 trickles is probably just going to reach everyone and dissipate in no time.
If you sponsor, you must obey the whole of advertising standards and regulation.
<br/>
16. Termination
You may terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your Account and discontinuing your use of all Services. If you stop using the Services without deactivating your Accounts, your Accounts may be deactivated due to prolonged inactivity.
